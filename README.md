Make a dynamic figure. Describe the following:

- data source
- what you want to convey in the table
- what functionality you put into the table and why
- what formatting you put into the table and why

Update the code and final figure to GitHub. Make sure the code is functional on GitHub. Make sure your work can be replicated including pulling the data. If the work cannot be replicated give a short note explaining why (so we know you didnâ€™t just skip this part).

You are not limited to one table. You may make more than one table/figure to communicate the data. At least one table must be provided.

You can make one html file in your repo that has your figure and your figure discussion.
